# Rainfall Analysis Dashboard
**Project Code:** `P6-Rainfall-Analysis`

##  Project Overview
This Tableau project visualizes rainfall patterns across regions and time periods to identify seasonal trends, anomalies, and long-term climate changes. It is aimed at supporting agricultural planning, water resource management, and climate research.

##  Objectives
- Analyze rainfall distribution across different regions.
- Study seasonal and monthly rainfall variations.
- Identify years with extreme rainfall events (droughts or floods).
- Detect long-term rainfall trends over decades.
- Provide an interactive dashboard for in-depth exploration.

##  Key Analyses & Visualizations
